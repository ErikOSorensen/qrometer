# Cable between sensor and controller

The cable is made out of multistrand CAT-5 cable, about 75 cm long. 

On each end, there is a female GX-16-4 connector, known on Aliexpress as an
"aviation connector."

Four of the wires are left unused (the striped ones), and the solid colors are 
wired up connecting to the pins as follows:

1. Blue (GND)
2. Green (12V)
3. "Yellow" (forward power)
4. Brown (reflected power)
